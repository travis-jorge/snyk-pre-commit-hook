# This hook will use 3 of the four scans that Snyk offers, and it can be customized to fit the tests you want to make sure are run
# Snyk covers open source vulnerability detection, container vulnerabilities, infrascructure as code misconfigurations, and static code analysis scanning
# For container scanning, we recommend this be done manually as an image name is necessary as a part of the arguments

# It is recommended to learn about the Snyk file and how it works to ignore local vulnerabilities
